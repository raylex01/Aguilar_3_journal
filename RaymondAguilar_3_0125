What I could have done differently was being focused more on the timeline and doing everything when it needed to be done
I should have worked on my map over winter break which I did not do. If I had added an enemy it would bring me closer to a finished
game. I need to add an enemy and create a lose and win screen, I need to resize my objects and move them to new locations then I
will be finished.
