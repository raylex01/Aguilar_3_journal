The Slick assignment was intended to gently familiarize you with 2-D arrays. 
Some students recognized the 2-D arrays from Slick and previous journals --- 
other students had no recollection. Which were you? Why? Note - attributing the environment is not pragmatic - 
as students experienced the same environment (though they might have experienced it differently)
Make a list of ten questions related to the Array assignments pt 1 and 2 - 
that you predict will be on the semester exam. E.g., object initialization, class constructors, creating and changing arrays, etc.

I remembered a little bit from Slick but I did not realize that it was a similar concept until I began adding objects and things
into my game.

1. How do you initialize an object?
2. How can you create a class?
3. What are class constructors used for?
4. How do you create an array?
5. How can you add an object to an array?
6. How can you make a class constructor?
7. How can you make an array bigger?
8. How do you make it to where when you touch a trap you die?
9. How did you make your enemy move?
10. How did you add directions such as North East and North West?
