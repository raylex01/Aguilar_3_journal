How do you add an image to a slick game?
To add an image you must create a class for the object then once youre in the 
class you will need to create a method and one of the things you will need to do is add the image
to the res folder then in netbeans you type res/ the name of the picture then .png

Where is the image drawn? [What code? Be specific.] 
The image is drawn in the class for that object. This is the code for adding an image

class item1 {
	public int x;
	public int y;
	public boolean isvisible = true;
	Image currentImage;
	Shape hitbox;
	Image healthpotion = new Image("res/speed.png");

	item1(int a, int b) throws SlickException {
		this.x = a;
		this.y = b;
		this.hitbox = new Rectangle(a, b, 300, 300);// 64 is the width of the item
		this.currentImage = healthpotion;

	}

}
