It is important to organize your thoughts because its better to understand
the process and how the code actually works then to just copy and paste it 
and not know what it does or how it works. Organizing your thoughts and 
getting to know the program  helps make you a  better problem  solver, this class 
is about more than  code its about becoming better problem solvers and being awesome.
