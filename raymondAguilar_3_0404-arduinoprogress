Describe the progress you have made on your project.
My partner and I have thought of an idea and we are currently trying to get the piezo buzzer to play song.

What have you done?
We have added new notes and changed the frequencies of notes that were already in the code.

What do you need to do?
We need to get the buzzer to play the entire song and program LED's to correspond with the beat of the song.

What will you be able to turn in on Friday?
We will be able to turn in a piezo buzzer that plays a song.

What code changes are you writing?
We are adding new notes to the program, we are also adding pauses, and telling the buzzer what order to play the notes.
