  What differences and similarites have you noticed? Provide at least 3 and explain in complete sentences.
One of the differences I have noticed is that I dont have to create separate classses and the code is a lot simpler and shorter, theres
not a lot that needs to be typed to get the code to work. 

  What code adaptations have you made?
The code adaptions we have made are changing the frequencies on the notes, adding new notes, and programming the Piezo Buzzer to play a 
song for our project.

  What is required for a circuit?
Wires must be connected to the power on the breadboard and Arduino to get the circuit to work, You will also need a resistor and anything
else you would need depending on what you want to do. LED, LCD, Piezo buzzer, etc.

  How are programs compiled with Arduino?
Arduino code is shorter and includes a lot of comments to separate everything and help us understand and learn what the code does and how
we should read it.

  Describe the projects you have completed this/last week and what you have learned from them.
Our projects have included simple circuits such as getting an LED TO work or how to get the piezo buzzer to play a melody, to more 
complicated circuits that require more wires and more components to get it to work. I have learned how to use a breadboard and how it 
works, I have also learned about different parts and pieces of equipment that I never knew about like an Arduino, resistors, and
potentiometers, etc.

  Describe your project and the code adaptations you will have to make.
My partner and I will use the Piezo buzzer to play a song while LED'S flash during the song, We will need to add new notes, change the 
frequency of the sounds, add rests and pauses, and just program the buzzer to play our song. We will be using "Tequila" by The Champs but 
we must figure out how to put the code for the buzzer and the code for the LED'S in the same code.
