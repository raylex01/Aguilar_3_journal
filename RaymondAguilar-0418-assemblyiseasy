For what computational reason did you type elf64?
We typed elf64 because it is a 64 bit operating system.

Why did you use ld?

Why did you not have to use chmod to make sample executable?

Now - change the code to print your name. You should change the program so that it actually prints your name.
raylex01@ninja15:~$ pico sample.asm
raylex01@ninja15:~$ nasm -f elf64 -l sample.lst sample.asm
raylex01@ninja15:~$ ld -s -o sample sample.o
raylex01@ninja15:~$ ./sample

What problem did you have to solve to get it to work?

Given your actual experience with Assembly now --- Is assembly 'quick and easy'? Why or why not?
No. Assembly is not quick and easy, you must type a lot more and know a lot more about coding to complete a simple task like 
drawing a line. It is much more difficult than Java.

What does 'low level' actually mean with regards to programming languages?
Low level means that you are a lot closer to the raw code and you have to do a lot more to complete 
a simple task.
