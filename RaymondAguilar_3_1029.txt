Is your guessing game a game? why or why not?

No my guessing game is not a game, I have not started a guessing game and i do not have one. I am still trying to figure
out how to create it and learn how to make it and know what it does.

What would make it better?

If i actually started on one and actually made a guessing game that would make it better than having nothing at all.
