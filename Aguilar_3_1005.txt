What are code comments? What are they good for?

Code comments are small comments from the creator that can be left on the
project and in the code, When you write a code comment its basically like 
getting a post it note and writing down a message or directions telling the
user how the program works and what it does and then sticking it to your
project. Its basically to help the reader or user know what is going on and
why certain things are in certain places.
