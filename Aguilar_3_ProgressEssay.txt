For my netbeans project I haven't been making much progress. I am very
confused and I do no really know what im supposed to be doing. I am in the 
process of creating a void that I can put my art into. I want to make an 
abstract piece using squares, rectangles, and circles, but I am struggling 
and having a very hard time with this project and with Netbeans in general.
